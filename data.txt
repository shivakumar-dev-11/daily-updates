Client–Server Communication Flow
Components

 Frontend → Client

 Backend → Server

Database

Communication Flow

 Frontend (Client) sends a request to the Backend (Server)

 Request type: HTTP / HTTPS

 Data format: JSON parsed format / JSON object

 The request travels through the network / internet.

 Backend (Server) processes the request

 Communicates with the Database to fetch or store data.

 Backend sends a response back to the Frontend

 Response format: JSON parsed format

Network & Protocols

 To communicate between frontend and backend, we need the network / internet.

 The network uses two main protocols:

HTTP

 Plain text format

HTTPS

 Encrypted format (used for security)

AJAX

 To work with HTTP/HTTPS requests in the frontend, we use AJAX.

 AJAX allows sending and receiving data without reloading the page.

 JSON and Network Understanding

 The network cannot understand JavaScript objects or arrays.

 The network can only understand strings.

So:

 Objects must be converted to strings before sending.

 Strings must be converted back to objects after receiving.

JSON Methods
 While Sending Request

JSON.stringify()

  Converts JavaScript objects or arrays into a string

 Used before sending data over the network

 While Receiving Response

JSON.parse()

 Converts received string data back into a JavaScript object

  Used after receiving data in frontend or backend

Simple Summary

 Frontend ↔ Backend communication happens via HTTP/HTTPS

 Data format used is JSON

 Network understands only strings

 JSON.stringify() → send data

 JSON.parse() → read received data

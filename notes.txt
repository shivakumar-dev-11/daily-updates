Data Types
1. User-defined Data Types

a. Array
b. Object
c. Functions

2. Pre-defined Data Types

a. String
b. Boolean
c. Numbers
d. Null / Undefined

Functions

Functions are a collection of statements used to perform a task.

Events

User interactions with the application are called events.

Examples:

onclick

onChange

onSubmit

onReset

Operators
1. Arithmetic Operators

+ , - , * , / , ++ , -- , etc

2. Logical Operators

&& , || , !

3. Comparison Operators

>= , <= , < , > , == , === , ? (ternary operator)

4. Assignment Operators

= , += , -= , /=


switch
if–else Syntax
if (user === loggedIn) {
  console.log('hello user');
} else {
  console.log('please login');
}

if (dark) {
  giveDark;
} else if (white) {
  giveWhite;
} else {
  default;
}

switch Statement

Syntax:

switch (value) {
  case 'some case': {
    doThis;
    break;
  }

  case 'some other case': {
    doThis;
    break;
  }

  case 'nothing': {
    // don't do anything
    break;
  }

  default: {
    stayInGroundFloor;
  }
}


1.7 Looping Statements

Looping statements execute a block of code repeatedly until the condition becomes false.

Types of loops:

for

while

do-while

for-in

1. For Loop
Syntax:
for (initialisation; condition; increment/decrement) {
  // logic statements
}

2. For-in Loop

for-in loop is used only to iterate through objects.

for, while, and do-while loops are generally used to iterate through arrays.

for-in loop iterates through object keys.

Difference:

Arrays → iterated based on index

Objects → iterated from starting key to ending key

Syntax:
for (var key in objectName) {
  objectName[key]; // returns the value of that key
}

Example: for-in loop with Object
const exampleObj = {
  x: 1,
  y: 2,
  z: 3
};

for (var key in exampleObj) {
  console.log(exampleObj[key]);
}


1.8 Array Methods

push()
→ Adds a value at the last index position of an array.

pop()
→ Removes a value from the last index position of an array.

arrayName.toString()
→ Converts the whole array into a string.

splice()
→ Used to add/remove elements in an array.
Syntax:

splice(indexPosition, deleteCount, newValue)

Functions (Very Very Important)
1. Named Function / Function Constructor
Syntax
function functionName() {
  return ...;
}

Explanation

Used to trigger a function whenever needed in the application.

It can be called any number of times.

2. IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)
Definition

A function which is invoked/called by itself.

It executes only once, because we cannot call it again externally.

Syntax
(function(arg1, arg2, arg3, ..., argn) {
  // statements we want to execute
})(param1, param2, param3, ..., paramn);


👉 Here, we are defining and calling the function at the same time.

Important Point

The function does not have a name because we don’t call it externally.

3. Anonymous Function
Definition

A function without a name is called an Anonymous Function.

Syntax
var x = function(params) {
  // statements
  return 1;
};

var x = 1;

Usage

Mainly used inside objects.

Also used when we want to write one function inside another function.

4. Callback Function
Definition

A function which is passed as a parameter/argument to another function is called a Callback Function.

Syntax
function a() {
  // statements
}

function b(a) {
  // statements
  // this will be called callback function
}


Pre-defined Functions:

setTimeout

setInterval

These are the pre-defined functions which are provided for us.

Asynchronous operations:

Means it will be executed at some other time.

Synchronous operations

(Executed immediately, one after another)

JavaScript Code (setTimeout & setInterval Example):
<script>
  function displayText() {
    document.getElementById("timeout-text").innerHTML =
      "This is a dynamic text coming from set timeout";
  }

  setTimeout(displayText, 3000);

  function intervalText() {
    console.log("This is interval text");
  }

  setInterval(intervalText, 5000);

  console.log("another text");
</script>
